In order to estimate the class of a data point, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the **most probable class** for that data point. For this, we use **Logistic Regression**.\n","\n","<div class=\"alert alert-success alertsuccess\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">\n","<font size = 3><strong>Recall linear regression:</strong></font>\n","<br>\n","<br>\n","As you know,  Linear regression finds a function that relates a continuous dependent variable, $y$, to some predictors (independent variables $x_1$,  $x_2$, etc.). For example, Simple linear regression assumes a function of the form:\n","<br><br>\n","$$\n","y = w_0 + w_1 * x_1 + w_2 * x_2 +...\n","$$\n","<br>\n","and finds the values of parameters  $w_0$, $w_1$, $w_2$, etc, where the term $w_0$ is the \"intercept\".

However, while the actual label of 9 customers were 1, the classifier predicted those as 0, which is not very good. We can consider it as error of the model for first row.\n","\n","What about the customers with churn value 0? Lets look at the second row.\n","It looks like  there were 25 customers whom their churn value were 0. \n","\n","\n","The classifier correctly predicted 24 of them as 0, and one of them wrongly as 1. So, it has done a good job in predicting the customers with churn value 0. A good thing about confusion matrix is that shows the model‚Äôs ability to correctly predict or separate the classes.  In specific case of binary classifier, such as this example,  we can interpret these numbers as the count of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
