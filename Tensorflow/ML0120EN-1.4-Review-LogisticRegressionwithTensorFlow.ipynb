In order to estimate a classification, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the **most probable class** for that data point. For this, we use **Logistic Regression**.\n","\n","<div class=\"alert alert-success alertsuccess\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">\n","<font size = 3><strong>Recall linear regression:</strong></font>\n","<br>\n","<br>\n","Linear regression finds a function that relates a continuous dependent variable, $y$, to some predictors (independent variables $x_1$, $x_2$, etc.).

Logistic regression fits a special s-shaped curve by taking the linear regression and transforming the numeric estimate into a probability with the following function:\n","\n","$$\n","ProbabilityOfaClass = \\theta(y) = \\frac{e^y}{1+e^y} = exp(y) / (1+exp(y)) = p \n","$$\n","\n","which produces p-values between 0 (as y approaches minus infinity) and 1 (as y approaches plus infinity).
